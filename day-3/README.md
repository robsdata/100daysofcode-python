# Day 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators

## Overview

### Objective

Conditional statements, if else, else if, logical operators, code blocks, scope, global and local name spacing

### Project

## Lesson Cheat Sheet

### If

This is the basic syntax to test if a condition is true. If so, the indented code will be
executed, if not it will be skipped. 

### Else

This is a way to specify some code that will be executed if a condition is false.

### Elif

In addition to the initial If statement condition, you can add extra conditions to test if the first  condition is false. Once an elif condition is true, the rest of the elif conditions are no longer checked
and are skipped.

### and

This expects both conditions either side of the and to be true.

### or

This expects either of the conditions either side of the or to be true. Basically, both
conditions cannot be false.

### not

This will flip the original result of the condition. e.g. if it was true then it's now false.

## Comparison Operators

These mathematical comparison operators allow you to refine your conditional checks

```python
> Greater than
< Lesser than
= Greater than or equal to
<= Lesser than or equal to
== Is equal to
!= Is not equal to
```
