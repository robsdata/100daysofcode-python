"""
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

1 year = 365 days
1 year = 52 weeks
1 year = 12 months


Example output: 

You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
