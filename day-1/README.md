### **Print**

Prints a string into the console. `print("Hello World")`

### Syntax Errors

They are **produced by Python when it is translating the source code into byte code**. They usually indicate that there is something wrong with the syntax of the program.

### Indentation Error

They can occur **when the spaces or tabs are not placed properly**. There will not be an issue if the interpreter does not find any issues with the spaces or tabs.

### Input

Prints a string into the console, and asks the user for a string input.

### Comments

Adding a # symbol in font of text lets you make comments on a line of code. The computer will ignore your comments.

### Variables

A variable give a name to a piece of data. Like a box with a label, it tells you what's inside the box.
